## üìä **Root Causes & Solutions Timeline**

### **July 14, 2025 - Original Investigation**
**Discovered by:** [@bakiel](https://github.com/bakiel)  
**Root Cause:** Shell configuration corruption (`.zshrc` parse errors)  
**Platform:** macOS  
**Solution:** Shell configuration repair + environment restart  

**Methodology:** Systematic elimination through fresh user account testing

### **July 14, 2025 - Cache Corruption Discovery**
**Discovered by:** [@xianjun-zhang](https://github.com/xianjun-zhang)  
**Root Cause:** Corrupted Claude CLI cache  
**Platform:** WSL2/Linux  
**Solution:** Cache directory deletion  

**Key Insight:** Same symptoms, different root cause - validates systematic methodology

## üîç **Solution Matrix by Platform**

| Platform | Primary Solution | Secondary Solution | Cache Location |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **macOS** | Shell config fix | Cache cleanup | `~/Library/Caches/claude-cli-nodejs` |
| **Linux/WSL2** | Cache cleanup | Shell config fix | `~/.cache/claude-cli-nodejs` |
| **Windows** | Cache cleanup | PowerShell profile | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\claude-cli-nodejs` |

## üéØ **Contributor Insights**

### **[@xianjun-zhang](https://github.com/xianjun-zhang) - Cache Corruption Discovery**

**Original Issue Context:**
- **Version:** Claude CLI 1.0.51
- **Platform:** WSL2 (Ubuntu on Windows)
- **Shell Status:** `.zshrc` working correctly 
- **Attempted Solutions:** Standard cleanup methods failed

**Breakthrough Discovery:**
```bash
# This command resolved the immediate compaction issue
rm -rf /Users/xxxx/Library/Caches/claude-cli-nodejs
```
