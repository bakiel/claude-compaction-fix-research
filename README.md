# Claude Code Compaction Fix - Complete Solution

## üö® **TL;DR: MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS FOUND**
**Root Causes Identified:** Shell configuration corruption + Cache corruption  
**Solutions:** Shell config repair OR cache cleanup  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **SOLVED** - Multiple proven fixes for different platforms!

---

## üéØ **The Problem**
Claude Code immediately shows "Context left until auto-compact: 0%" on any input, making it unusable:
- ‚ùå Context compaction triggers on every single input
- ‚ùå 82-second compaction cycles constantly
- ‚ùå No normal project analysis possible
- ‚ùå "Cheeky compaction" behavior that survives app reinstalls

## üèÜ **Multiple Root Causes & Solutions**

### **Solution 1: Shell Configuration Fix (macOS)**
**Root Cause:** Corrupted `.zshrc` shell configuration

```bash
# 1. Check for .zshrc parse errors
zsh -n ~/.zshrc

# 2. Fix any parse errors (common: missing brackets, quotes)
nano ~/.zshrc

# 3. Restart shell environment
source ~/.zshrc

# 4. Test Claude Code
claude
# Should now show normal context percentages!
```

### **Solution 2: Cache Cleanup (Cross-Platform)**
**Root Cause:** Corrupted Claude CLI cache  
**Discovered by:** [@xianjun-zhang](https://github.com/xianjun-zhang)

```bash
# Linux/WSL2
rm -rf ~/.cache/claude-cli-nodejs

# macOS
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/claude-cli-nodejs

# Windows
# Delete cache from AppData\Local\claude-cli-nodejs

# Test Claude Code
claude
# Should now show normal context percentages!
```

### **Nuclear Option (if both above fail):**
```bash
# Backup and reset shell config
mv ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.broken
# Create minimal .zshrc or copy from fresh user
# Restart terminal and test Claude Code
```

## üîç **How We Found These Solutions**

### **Systematic Investigation Process**
These solutions came from **systematic elimination** of possible causes:

1. **‚ùå Network Issues** - VPN test failed to fix (ruled out ISP/routing)
2. **‚ùå System Corruption** - Fresh user account worked perfectly (ruled out system-wide)
3. **‚ùå Application Issues** - Reinstalls failed to fix (ruled out app corruption)
4. **‚úÖ User Environment Issues** - Multiple discoveries:
   - Shell configuration corruption (original investigation)
   - Cache corruption (community discovery)

### **The Breakthrough Process**
- **Original Discovery:** Fresh macOS user account showed normal behavior + `.zshrc` parse error identified
- **Community Extension:** WSL2 user with clean shell config found cache corruption as alternative cause
- **Cross-Platform Validation:** Same systematic methodology ‚Üí different root causes ‚Üí confirmed fixes

---

## üìä **Success Indicators**
After applying either fix, you should see:
- ‚úÖ **Context shows actual percentages** (30%, 60%, 90%) instead of immediate 0%
- ‚úÖ **Normal project analysis** without immediate compaction
- ‚úÖ **Manual `/compact` works** at logical breakpoints (30-40% remaining)
- ‚úÖ **No more "cheeky compaction"** on simple inputs

## üõ†Ô∏è **Platform-Specific Troubleshooting**

### **macOS:**
1. **Check shell config:** `zsh -n ~/.zshrc`
2. **Check cache:** `rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/claude-cli-nodejs`
3. **Check other shells:** `zsh -n ~/.zprofile ~/.bashrc ~/.bash_profile`

### **Linux/WSL2:**
1. **Check cache first:** `rm -rf ~/.cache/claude-cli-nodejs`
2. **Check shell config:** `bash -n ~/.bashrc` or `zsh -n ~/.zshrc`
3. **Check environment:** `env | grep -i claude`

### **Windows:**
1. **Check cache:** Delete `%LOCALAPPDATA%\claude-cli-nodejs`
2. **Check PowerShell profile:** Test PowerShell configuration
3. **Check environment variables:** Review PATH and Claude-related variables

---

## üî¨ **Advanced Troubleshooting**

### **If Basic Fixes Don't Work:**
1. **Check other shell configs:**
   ```bash
   # Check all shell configuration files
   zsh -n ~/.zshrc ~/.zprofile ~/.bashrc ~/.bash_profile
   ```

2. **Environment variable conflicts:**
   ```bash
   # Look for Claude/Node environment issues
   env | grep -i claude
   env | grep -i node
   ```

3. **Nuclear user environment reset:**
   ```bash
   # Backup essential data first!
   rm -rf ~/.claude ~/.config/claude*
   rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude*
   rm -rf ~/Library/Preferences/com.anthropic*
   security delete-generic-password -a $USER -s "Claude Code"
   ```

### **Testing Fresh Account (Advanced):**
If nothing else works, test with a completely fresh user account to isolate the issue.

## üìö **Research Documentation**
This repository contains **complete investigation documentation** in the `docs/` folder:
- Systematic debugging methodology
- All theories tested and eliminated
- User account corruption analysis
- Community discoveries and contributions
- Cross-platform solution validation

**Total investigation time:** Several days of systematic research  
**Investigation quality:** Professional-grade systematic elimination  
**Community contributions:** Multiple confirmed solutions

## üéØ **Why This Matters**
Claude Code v1.0.51 compaction issues are **NOT version problems** - they're often **environment corruption** that can be fixed!

Multiple root causes have been identified:
- **Shell configuration corruption** (especially macOS)
- **Cache corruption** (cross-platform)
- **User environment conflicts** (various platforms)

Many users experiencing "immediate compaction" can solve their issues with these proven fixes rather than downgrading or waiting for updates.
